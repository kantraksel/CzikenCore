# How to use mod
Commands listed below can execute operators with permission level 3 or higher or admin via console.

All you need to know:
- addCziken <player> - adds player to whitelist. First user, who connects with the name, can join game as the player
- removeCziken <player> - removes player from whitelist. It only works, if player didn't connect to the server (=is not marked as *known*). 
You can't remove known player from whitelist, but hey... What about banning him/her?

If you're familiar with internal mechanics, there's command for you
- reloadCzikens - reloads player storage from file system
