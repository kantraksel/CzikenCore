# How to use mod
Commands listed below can execute operators with permission level 3 or higher or admin via console.

All you need to know:
- addCziken <player> - adds player to whitelist. First user, who connects with the name, can only play as that player
- removeCziken <player> - removes player from whitelist. It only works, if player didn't connect to the server
You can't remove existing player from whitelist, but hey... What about banning him/her?

If you're familiar with internal mechanics, there's command for you
- reloadCzikens - reloads storages from disk
